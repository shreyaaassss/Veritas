"""
DPDPA Compliance Agent — Detection Engine
=============================================
The bridge between Phase 2's Event stream and Presidio's analyzer.
Runs detect_event() on every Event pulled from the shared queue (or a
test fixture), producing a DetectedEvent.

WHAT GETS SCANNED (per the plan):
  - Every value in event.fields, individually — so we know WHICH field
    contains PII, not just that the event as a whole does. This matters
    because Phase 1's registry and Phase 4's rule engine key off
    field_name, not off the event as a blob.
  - event.raw_snippet, for ALL events regardless of source_type. The plan
    calls this out specifically for source_type == "log" (since PII in
    logs is often embedded in free text, e.g. support_tickets-style
    notes), but also says to scan raw_snippet for API events "for
    safety" if populated — and per Phase 2's normalizer design decision,
    raw_snippet is NEVER empty for API events (it holds the serialized
    JSON payload). So in practice this engine scans raw_snippet for
    every event unconditionally; the log-vs-api distinction only matters
    for HOW MUCH new signal raw_snippet scanning adds (structured API
    fields are already fully covered by the fields-scan, so raw_snippet
    matches on API events are expected to duplicate the fields matches;
    for log events, raw_snippet scanning is often the ONLY way PII in
    unstructured text gets caught).

DEDUPLICATION: because raw_snippet frequently contains the same values
already present in fields (e.g. Phase 2's log lines embed the same
name/phone/address that also appear in fields), we deduplicate matches
by (field, entity_type, matched_text) so a single real-world PII value
doesn't get double-counted just because it appears in both the
structured field and the serialized raw text. Field-sourced matches take
priority in dedup (they have a real field_name); a raw_snippet match is
only kept if its matched_text isn't already accounted for by a
field-sourced match.

NO LLM. NO RULE EVALUATION. This module's only job is: given an Event,
what PII is in it, where, and (Phase 2) whether it's been structurally/
checksum-confirmed.

PHASE 2 ADDITION — validator wiring: for each match sourced from a
structured field, we look up the triggering event's org config
(config_loader.load_org_config, keyed by event.tenant_id) to see whether
that field_name has a declared `identifiers[].validator`. If so, we run
the matched text through validators.get_validator(...) and tag the match
PATTERN_MATCH / VALIDATED / FAILED_VALIDATION accordingly (see
detection/models.py). This is a config *read*, not a registry/rule-engine
lookup — it does not consult get_registry_entry, and it never raises: a
missing org config, an undeclared identifier, or an unregistered
validator name all fall back to PATTERN_MATCH with a logged warning
rather than failing detection for the event. See _resolve_validation_status.
