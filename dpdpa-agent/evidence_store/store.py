DPDPA Compliance Agent — Evidence Store (Phase 6, multi-tenant since Phase 5+6)
=================================================================================
Append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained SQLite store for ExplainedVerdict objects.

DESIGN DECISIONS (documented per the plan's requirement):

1. IMMUTABILITY + MUTABILITY SPLIT:
   `remediation_status` and `remediation_updated_at` live in SEPARATE COLUMNS
   outside the hashed payload. The hash covers everything else — the full
   ExplainedVerdict JSON serialised deterministically. Updating remediaton
   status NEVER changes the stored hash, so verify_chain() passes before and
   after a status update. This is the simplest correct option.

2. HASH CHAIN — NOW PER-TENANT (Phase 5+6 change):
   Each row stores sha256(json(immutable_fields) + previous_row_hash). Before
   this phase, "previous_row_hash" was the immediately preceding row GLOBALLY
   (SELECT ... ORDER BY row_index DESC LIMIT 1, no tenant filter) — meaning
   org A's rows and org B's rows were interleaved into ONE chain, so
   verifying org A's evidence required touching org B's rows too. That broke
   the tenant-isolation goal: an org's auditor could not verify their own
   evidence independent of another org's data (or its presence/absence).

   FIX: the "previous hash" a new row chains into is now the last row
   belonging to the SAME tenant_id (_get_last_hash(tenant_id) — see below),
   falling back to GENESIS_HASH if this is that tenant's first-ever row. Each
   org therefore has its own independent hash chain, embedded in the same
   physical table (still one SQLite file, one row_index sequence — rows from
   different tenants can be physically interleaved by insertion order — but
   logically chained only within their own tenant's row sequence).
   verify_chain(tenant_id) replays ONLY that tenant's rows, in row_index
   order, starting from GENESIS_HASH. This is a pure query/chaining-scope
   change — the hash algorithm, what fields get hashed, and the append-only
   property are all unchanged (explicit non-goal of this phase).

   MIGRATION NOTE: a `tenant_id` column did not previously exist. On an
   existing on-disk DB (created before this phase), `_init_schema()` adds it
   and backfills every existing row's tenant_id from its own payload_json
   (which has always carried `verdict.tenant_id`, per Phase 0's schema — see
   `_serialize_immutable` below). Existing rows' `row_hash`/`previous_hash`
   values are NOT recomputed (that would violate the append-only/tamper-
   evidence guarantee retroactively) — they keep whatever chain they were
   originally written with. In this codebase's actual history, every row
   written before this phase was blinkit's (Phase 5 is the first time a
   non-blinkit tenant's verdicts could ever reach this store), so the
   pre-existing chain is — and remains, unchanged — exactly blinkit's
   per-tenant chain; no discontinuity is introduced for the common case.

3. STATUS TRANSITIONS:
   Only OPEN→ACKNOWLEDGED and ACKNOWLEDGED→RESOLVED are permitted. Attempting
   to go backwards (e.g. RESOLVED→OPEN) or skip (OPEN→RESOLVED) is rejected
   with a ValueError. ACKNOWLEDGED→ACKNOWLEDGED is also explicitly rejected
   (idempotent updates aren't meaningful here).

4. SQLITE CONCURRENCY:
   check_same_thread=False + a module-level threading.Lock guard every write.
   Sufficient for the hackathon single-process model.

5. SCHEMA EVOLUTION:
   All immutable verdict fields + explanation fields are stored as a single
   JSON blob column (`payload_json`) for simplicity. The mutable fields are
   their own indexed columns so queries and updates touch only those.
   `tenant_id` is ALSO its own indexed column (denormalised out of
   payload_json) purely so every read path can filter/chain efficiently
   without parsing JSON per row.

6. TENANT SCOPING (Phase 5+6):
   Every read (and write-adjacent) method — append, verify_chain, query,
   get_by_verdict_id, update_status, count — now takes tenant_id as a
   REQUIRED parameter (append derives it from the verdict itself; the rest
   take it explicitly) and scopes its SQL accordingly. There is no "list
   across all tenants" method — that was a deliberate removal, not an
   oversight: any such method would be exactly the kind of cross-tenant leak
   surface this phase exists to close. A caller that genuinely needs a
   cross-tenant admin view would need a new, explicitly-named method — none
   of Part A/B's callers need one, so none was added.

7. PER-TENANT SEQUENTIAL VIOLATION ID (post-Phase-6 addition):
   Every stored row also gets a plain, human-referenceable `violation_id` —
   1, 2, 3, ... — SCOPED PER TENANT (org A's #1 and org B's #1 are
   different rows; each tenant's numbering starts fresh at 1). This is
   deliberately NOT the same thing as the existing `row_index`: row_index
   is a GLOBAL SQLite AUTOINCREMENT shared by every tenant's physically
   interleaved rows (e.g. org A's rows could sit at global positions
   1, 3, 5 if org B wrote in between), so it was never actually usable as
   "the Nth violation for this org" — an auditor filtering to their own
   org would see gaps. `violation_id` fixes that: it's computed as
   MAX(existing violation_id for this tenant) + 1 at append time, inside
   the same write lock, so it is gap-free and race-safe per tenant.

   It is deliberately NOT added to the Verdict schema (schemas/models.py)
   or assigned by the rule engine — a violation only earns a permanent
   audit-trail number once it is durably stored, which is exactly what
   this layer already owns. This keeps Verdict (frozen since Phase 0) and
   rules/engine.py untouched.

   Lookup: get_by_sequence_number(tenant_id, violation_id) — the
   "tag @03 and ask what happened" workflow. Since the explanation was
   already generated and grounding-checked once at detection time (see
   llm_explainer/explainer.py), this is a plain stored-row lookup, not a
   fresh LLM call — instant, and doesn't re-spend an API call per lookup.
