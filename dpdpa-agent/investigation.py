Veritas — Breach Investigation Layer ("@N" reference-based LLM Q&A)
========================================================================
Lets an auditor reference an already-detected violation by its per-tenant
sequential `violation_id` (evidence_store/store.py) and ask free-form
questions about it — "@01 what happened", "@01 how do I fix this" —
answered by an LLM grounded in that violation's full stored record, not
fresh detection, not guesswork.

THE THREE REQUESTED LAYERS, and where each one actually lives:

  1. Breach Detection & ID Assignment — already built, untouched here:
     rules/engine.py + rules/linkage.py produce Verdicts; evidence_store/
     store.py assigns `violation_id` at append() time (MAX(existing)+1
     per tenant, inside the write lock — gap-free, race-safe, never
     reused). This module does not detect anything or assign IDs.

  2. Breach Context Retrieval — parse_reference() + evidence_store's
     get_by_violation_id() below. "@01" -> the complete stored record:
     rule_id, severity, field, source_system, timestamp, registry
     context, the original grounded explanation, and the statute text.

  3. LLM Investigation — investigate() below. Open-ended Q&A, grounded in
     exactly that record, with a lighter-weight version of the same
     integrity guardrail llm_explainer/explainer.py uses for its one
     fixed explanation.

GROUNDING PHILOSOPHY (adapted, not replaced, for open-ended Q&A):
  llm_explainer/explainer.py's grounding check works because it asks for
  ONE fixed field (section_cited) and can byte-compare it. A free-form
  answer to "give me remediation steps" has no single fact to compare.
  So the guardrail here is layered instead of a single check:
    - The prompt supplies ONLY this violation's stored record + its
      already-grounded statute snippet as ground truth, plus a small
      amount of computed aggregate context (e.g. "N other violations of
      this same rule exist for this org") so "has this happened
      elsewhere" is answerable from real data instead of an LLM guess.
    - temp=0, and the model is explicitly instructed it may cite ONLY
      the exact statute reference already on file for this violation —
      never a different section, never a different law.
    - Post-hoc: if the answer contains a section-citation-shaped string
      (a "§" character) that does NOT match this violation's own
      section_cited, the whole answer is discarded and replaced with the
      deterministic fallback — same "never show an ungrounded legal
      claim" property as explainer.py, just checked after the fact
      instead of via a fixed-schema field.
    - Remediation/practice advice is explicitly framed (to the model AND
      in the fallback text) as general guidance, not a new legal
      citation — it was never meant to be grounding-checked the same way
      a statute reference is.
    - ANY failure (no API key, network error, malformed response, failed
      section check) -> deterministic fallback built from the already-
      stored explanation. Never raises, never leaves an auditor with
      nothing to read.

CONVERSATION CONTINUITY: stateless on the server. The caller (dashboard
JS, or any API client) resends prior turns as `history` on every call —
the same pattern OpenAI's own chat API uses, and the pattern
api/integration.py's InvestigateRequest.history follows. No new session-
storage subsystem was added: the full breach record is re-supplied on
every turn regardless of how long the conversation runs, which is what
actually keeps every answer correct, not memory of earlier answers.
