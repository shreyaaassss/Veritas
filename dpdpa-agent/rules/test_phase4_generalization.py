Phase 4 Rule Engine Generalization Tests
============================================
Lean, targeted coverage for what Phase 4 actually changed/verified —
NOT a re-run of Phase 0/1/3's own test suites (registry config loading,
org config validation, and linkage-rule matching already have their own
dedicated tests; this file does not duplicate them).

Two things are worth new coverage here:

  1. Check 1 (Exposure) used to hardcode `source_system == "marketing-
     analytics"` — a Blinkit-specific string. Phase 4 replaced it with a
     config-driven probe (_forbids_raw_pii_here). The existing regression
     test (test_marketing_purpose_case_classified_as_exposure_per_design_
     decision_1) only proves the classification OUTCOME is unchanged for
     Blinkit's own data — it can't prove the hardcode is actually gone,
     since Blinkit's source_system is still literally "marketing-
     analytics". TestCheck1GeneralizesBeyondHardcodedSourceSystemName
     proves the fix generalizes, using a synthetic org whose deidentified-
     only source_system is deliberately named nothing like Blinkit's.

  2. Multi-tenant isolation at the RULE ENGINE layer (not just the
     registry-loader layer, which Phase 1's registry/test_registry.py
     already covers). TestMultiTenantIsolationInterleaved proves that
     interleaving evaluate_event() calls for two different orgs in the
     same process — including repeated/reordered calls, which would
     surface any cached "current org" state — never lets one org's
     config values leak into the other's verdicts. This is the exit
     criterion Phase 4 called "the most important correctness property
     of this phase."

A third, small class confirms rule_id naming is consistent across all
four categories (Exposure/Purpose/Retention/Linkage), per Deliverable 5.
