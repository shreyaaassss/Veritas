"""
DPDPA Compliance Agent — Shared Pydantic Models (Phase 0 — Generalised)
========================================================================
These models are the Python-side contract for all inter-module communication.
They mirror /schemas/event_schema.json and /schemas/verdict_schema.json exactly.

WHAT CHANGED IN PHASE 0:
  - `SourceSystem` enum is REMOVED. `source_system` is now a free-form `str`
    whose valid values are whatever the org declares in their Org Config file.
    No Veritas core module should ever hardcode a specific source_system string
    in branching logic — that is always a signal the Org Config schema is
    missing a field.
  - `tenant_id: str` is added to both Event and Verdict. Every event and
    every verdict must be tagged with which organisation it belongs to.
    This is the multi-tenancy anchor for all downstream partitioning
    (registry lookups, Evidence Store queries, dashboard views).

FROZEN AFTER PHASE 0 — do not modify fields, enums, or validation rules
without a full team review. All later phases depend on these contracts.

IMMUTABILITY CONTRACT (enforced at application level from Phase 6 onwards):
  On a Verdict, only `remediation_status` and `remediation_updated_at` may
  ever be mutated after the record is written to the Evidence Store. Every
  other field (including tenant_id) is immutable and will form part of a
  SHA-256 hash chain. Do NOT write any code that mutates other Verdict
  fields post-write.
