"""
Veritas DPDPA Agent — PII Masking Utility (Phase 5)
=======================================================
No existing masking/redaction logic was found anywhere in the codebase
(the dashboard never renders raw PII values at all — it only shows
field/rule/explanation metadata) — this is a small, focused utility built
fresh for the /scan endpoint (Part A2) and the CLI PoC (Part A3), per the
plan's explicit fallback instruction.

Goal: replace each detected PII substring with a CATEGORY-LABELED
placeholder (e.g. "[AADHAAR_REDACTED]", "[PHONE_REDACTED]") rather than
either the raw value or an information-losing generic "[REDACTED]" — an
auditor or a developer piping a log line through the CLI should be able to
see WHAT KIND of PII was there without ever seeing the value itself.

APPROACH: substring replacement, not span/offset-based. detection/models.py's
MatchedEntity carries `matched_text` but not the original start/end offsets
(detection/engine.py discards them after slicing) — re-deriving true spans
would mean re-running Presidio a second time just for masking. For a "small,
focused utility" this is unnecessary: replacing every occurrence of each
matched_text substring (longest first, so a shorter match can never
corrupt a longer overlapping one already replaced) is correct for the
overwhelmingly common case (a PII value appearing once, or repeated
identically) and safe even for repeats — if the same phone number appears
twice, both occurrences ARE that phone number and both should be masked.

KNOWN LIMITATION (documented, not silently patched — matches this
codebase's existing convention, see detection/README.md's own "Known
Limitations" section): when two of Presidio's OWN matches genuinely
OVERLAP rather than nest cleanly (e.g. spaCy's PERSON recognizer
occasionally matches a span like "pan ABCDE1234F" — swallowing a
neighboring word into what should have been an isolated PAN match, a
pre-existing spaCy precision issue documented in detection/README.md,
not something this module causes), the longer span is masked first and
the shorter, more specific match's substring may no longer be present to
replace — that specific value still gets masked (nothing leaks), but
under the coarser/wrong category label instead of its own. This is a
correctness trade-off inherent to substring-based (not offset-based)
masking; a span-based rewrite would close it but was judged out of scope
for this phase's "small, focused utility" instruction.
